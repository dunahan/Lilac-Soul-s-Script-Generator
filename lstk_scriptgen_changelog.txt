Change log, Lilac Soul's NNW Script Generator version 2.3 to The Krit's revision
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General functionality
---------------------
* The system tray, program update, and donate options are gone.
* Added the current directory to the search for NWN. This might help some
  people who previously had to locate NWN manually.
* The handling of checks for whether or not a PC triggered a script has been
  made more refined, with a new option to only check the "usual suspects".
* Miscellaneous interface tweaks, including a more consistent presentation
  for choosing a object to be affected by the script. In most places, this
  means more choices.
  * The most recent spawn and "last actor" have been added as choices for
    objects that the script can affect.
* I regenerated most of the symbolic constant choices, using both nwscript.nss
  and various .2da's as sources. This means more choices in several places.
  * Most (if not all) instances of symbolic constants being displayed have
    been changed to more descriptive names (usually generated from .2da information, so there may be some oddities left here).[/list][*] Speeded up palette searches.
* Loading a module's palette will also load the palettes from that module's
  hak paks (but the priority system is ignored, possibly affecting cases
  where the same blueprint exists in multiple hak paks). Custom talk tables
  are also now supported.
* In some places with "okay and more" buttons, users can see a list of what
  they have done so far.
* Spruced up the icon for today's larger sizes.


Script changes
--------------
* Comments have been added to scripts. These are the English sentences after
  a pair of slashes (//). These are for your reference; you can change them
  (the comments, not the slashes) to whatever you want.
* Scripts follow a cleaner format now. (The apology for the non-clean scripts
  has consequentially been removed.)
* Blacksmith scripts have been revamped. This will break any auxiliary
  scripts anyone may have written to interact with a blacksmith under the old
  system. (The older format is still recognized though, for those wanting to
  expand an existing blacksmith script. The result will be a conversion to
  the new format.
* Blacksmith scripts now use  x0_inc_skills  (the trap crafting library).
  Normally this is a non-issue, but there is a (small) chance that someone
  would modify this library for crafting, thinking nothing else uses it. If
  so, there is another small chance that those changes might break the
  blacksmith scripts. (Specifically, the functions  DestroyNumItems()  and
  skillCTRAPGetHasComponent() are needed.)
* Tag-based scripts use a new new system (compatible with the previous new
  system).
* The "nw_i0_tool" conflicts have been eliminated.
* The "ls_party" #include for party-wide local variables is automatically
  referenced if needed. Users are still responsible for copying that script
  into their module though.
* Heartbeat scripts now have an option to abort if no PC is seen.
* When it made sense, finding objects by tag has been changed to find the
  nearest object with that tag or to find an item in a particular inventory
  with that tag. This will let those scripts function properly when there is
  more than one object with that tag.
* Leveling creatures is no longer strictly restricted to henchmen, but it is
  still found with the other henchmen functionality.
  * Similarly, the option to destroy a henchman can be used to destroy
    objects that are not henchmen. Be careful if you are trying to *only*
    destroy a creature if it is a henchman. (Identifying a creature by its
    tag will only find henchmen.)
* There is better support for multiple henchmen.
* You can now unpossess a familiar if you (just) know which object is the
  familiar. (This is an alternative to knowing which object is the PC.) If
  this is done and the possessed familiar had been called "the PC", then
  future references to "the PC" will mean the master.
* Storing PC/party info can now be delayed. (The stored info will be
  calculated after the delay.)
* Speaking text is no longer an action unless done through the action queue
  window.


New options for conditionals/checks
-----------------------------------
* When checking for an equipped item, there are new options for "either hand"
  and "either ring" (and "any creature weapon").
* Can check for a PC being triple-classed (as well as multi-classed).
* For "Text Appears When" scripts, the race check now allows selecting
  multiple races.
* When making a skill check, there is now always a check that the PC can
  actually use the skill (relevant for skills that require training).
* Skill checks can be hidden from players.
* Journal quests can be checked for being exactly at a given stage.
* Copied some "Text Appears When" checks to "if" statement options, and vice
  versa. Similarly for restrictions on when a script runs.


New options for "normal" scripts
--------------------------------
* When restricting when a script fires, there is an option for once per
  creature as well as once per tag.
* Packages can be selected when leveling a creature.
* Creatures spawned on a delay can now be given an action (only one though)
  to do upon spawning.
* Dice have been added as options for determining a damage amount. (It is
  D&D after all. :) )
* The cursed flag (undroppable by players) on items can be changed.
* Weather can be set module-wide.
* Reputation adjustments can be made party-wide.
* An area's battle music can be set, started, and stopped.
* Added an option to write a message to the log file.
* Added an option for a creature to play one of its voice/quick chat lines.
* Messages (to players or to the log) can contain the PC's and/or the script
  owner's names.
* You can now jump the PC and (just) that PC's associates. (This is for when
  jumping within an area, as with secret doors.)
* Visual effects that require a duration have been added as options.


New options for blacksmith scripts
----------------------------------
* Blacksmith scripts can check for a certain number of a given item as an
  ingredient.


1.69 additions
--------------
* The palette window reads the "x3" .bif (horse blueprints mostly).
* PDK has been added to the class choices.
* Alignment adjustments can be for just the PC, not the party.
* New appearances, wings, tails, and visual effects added to the lists.
  * Added support specifically for scaled appearances.
* Descriptions can be changed.
* Creature colors can be changed (for part-based appearances).
* Paladin mounts can be summoned and dismissed.
* Horses can be mounted and dismounted.


And miscellaneous bugs squashed as they were found.
